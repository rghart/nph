Last week, we set up a basic React app and learned about the `useState` hook. This week, we'll take that further by learning about `useEffect`. Finally, we'll add some unit tests to make sure our UI is working the way we expect.

## useEffect
[React useEffect docs](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-effect.html)

## Unit Testing
* Add [Jest](https://jestjs.io/docs/en/getting-started.html)
* Add [React Testing Library](https://testing-library.com/docs/react-testing-library/intro/)
* Add [Jest DOM](https://github.com/testing-library/jest-dom)
